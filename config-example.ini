[AGWPE]
; host=localhost
; port=8000

; The maximum number of bytes to send to AGWPE in a single data frame:
; frameLength=256
; The effect of this value varies, depending on the implementation of AGWPE.
; SoundModem by UZ7HO transmits a long data frame as one long packet.
; Direwolf breaks up a long frame into packets of PACLEN bytes each.
; Large values may not work at all; for example Direwolf v1.7 will
; reset the TCP connection if you send much more than 2KBytes.
